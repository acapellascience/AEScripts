# AEScripts
Useful scripts for After Effects from the A Capella Science toolbox.

Hi! Welcome to my After Effects scripts. These scripts are NOT robust. They will not cover all your edge-cases. They are quick-and-dirty scripts that I threw together to solve specific problems in After Effects that come up when I make my videos. If you want to make videos like mine, maybe you'll find them useful!
